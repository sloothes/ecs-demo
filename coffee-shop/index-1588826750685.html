			// # A Minimalist Entity/Component System
			//
			// An Entity/Component System is an architecture for defining complex groups of
			// objects with pluggable behaviour. It finds its origins in game development,
			// where the more traditional object-oriented model was found wanting.
			//
			// As you may have guessed from the name an Entity/Component System is built on
			// three basic concepts:
			// 
			// * Entities: these are little more than a name, or a handle, for an object.
			//   In particular it has no state or behaviour of its own.
			// * Components: these hold a logical unit of state. A typical example of a
			//   component is "position", which could hold coordinates and orientation.
			//   Entities get assigned components, which means they somehow get related.
			//   Similar to entities, components have no behaviour of their own either.
			// * Systems: these hold a logical unit of behaviour, which gets applied to
			//   a selection of entities which are related to certain kinds of components.
			//   An example of a system could be "movement", which might select all
			//   entities which are assigned a position, and which could then update that
			//   position.
			//
			// All of this makes for a very dynamic architecture. You can add and remove
			// systems as needed, effectively extending the runtime behaviour. Similarly,
			// you can assign or remove components to and from entities as well. Doing so
			// would let them get picked up (or drop out from) specific behaviour.
			//
			// Well, there's a lot more to it than that, and on the web you'll find many
			// more interesting examples. The [Entity Systems Wiki](http://entity-systems.wikidot.com/) 
			// provides an excellent starting point.

			var ecs = (function () {
				// When implementing an Entity/Component System, the main choice we have to
				// make is how to represent and link entities and components. Because this is
				// a minimalist implementation, we're going to choose a simple option. Both
				// entities and components will be Javascript objects. The components will
				// get added to the entity objects on the fly.
				//
				// Let's get started.

				// ## Entities
				//
				// The systems will need some way to query all entities. To make that
				// possible the engine will keep track of all entities which get created.
				var entities = []

				// As we said, an entity is just an object. It has no data or behaviour.
				// All we want it to do is add itself into the list of entities.
				function Entity() {
					entities.push(this)
				}

				// ## Components
				//
				// Components, of course, do have state. That's exactly what they're about.
				// Unfortunately, we don't really know what state that is. It is up to the
				// client to define component constructors.
				// 
				// What we do need to define, however, is a way to link components to
				// entities. We do that by assigning the component to a new field in the
				// entity, the name of which is the name of the type of the component. This
				// means that the client should give all component types unique names; which
				// shouldn't be too bad of a requirement to have to deal with.
				Entity.prototype.add = function(component) {
					this[component.constructor.name.toLowerCase()] = component
					return this
				}
				// Note that we return `this`; we do so to allow the caller to chain multiple
				// of these calls in one go. After all, it is quite likely that an entity
				// will have more than one component linked to it.

				// Having added components to an entity, this allows you to retrieve one from
				// an entity.
				Entity.prototype.get = function(component_constructor) {
					return this[component_constructor.name.toLowerCase()]
				}

				// To unlink the component from the entity again, we just nullify the value.
				Entity.prototype.remove = function(component_constructor) {
					this[component_constructor.name.toLowerCase()] = null
					return this
				}

				// ## Systems
				//
				// As systems are units of behaviour, systems will be modeled as simple
				// functions. Again it is up to the client to define these; the engine itself
				// can not know what that should be.

				// ## Supporting functions
				//
				// So far this minimalist implementation has been just that: minimalist. We
				// basically said that it is up to the client to define what she wants... The
				// client, however, could use some extra supporting functions to make life on
				// her side easier. The major thing she needs to be able to do is to query
				// the engine for entities which have a certain combination of components.

				// Let's start by adding a test to entities to see if it has a specific set
				// of components. We can do this easily by looping over all components and
				// checking whether the entity has the corresponding field.
				Entity.prototype.has_all = function(component_constructors) {
					for (var i = 0; i < component_constructors.length; i++) {
						var component = this.get(component_constructors[i])
						if (typeof component === 'undefined' || component == null)
							return false
							}

					return true
				}

				// The query itself then. We'll set this up in typical callback style. That
				// is, the query will apply the specified callback against each of the
				// matching entities. E.g. `for_each([position, sound], console.log)` would
				// write all entities to console which have a position and sound component.
				function for_each(component_constructors, fn) {
					for (var i = 0; i < entities.length; i++) {
						var entity = entities[i];
						if (entity.has_all(component_constructors)) fn(entity);
					}
				}

				// You can think of the entities and components as a queryable database (and,
				// in fact, you could probably use database optimization techniques to make
				// the engine faster). A useful thing to do in a database is to get a count
				// of matching rows. Here we'll do something similar: returning a count of
				// matching entities.
				function count(component_constructors) {
					var c = 0;
					for (var i = 0; i < entities.length; i++) {
						var entity = entities[i];
						if (entity.has_all(component_constructors)) c += 1;
					}
					return c;
				}

				// The above functions will make it possible for systems to select relevant
				// entities and process them as needed. What we're still missing is a nice
				// and easy way for the client to select relevant systems and call them as
				// needed. This will be our final function.
				//
				// We're going to set this up as a curried function of sorts. That is, the
				// result of this function will be another function which can then be used to
				// invoke each of the systems in the orginal order specified. In addition,
				// any arguments passed to this function will also be provided to the
				// systems.
				//
				// An example would probably make this more clear. Let's say we're working in
				// the context of a game. We could then set up the update function by doing:
				// `var update = systematic(movement, rendering)`. Then, on each game tick
				// you just invoke `update(game_tick)`. This would cause the "movement" and
				// "rendering" systems to get invoked (in that order), and each would get the
				// current "game_tick" value as an input.
				//
				// With that all said, let's get to the code.
				function systematic() {
					// This is just a varargs trick. It captures all of the argumenst to the
					// function in an array.
					var systems = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 0);

					// This function then just iterates over this list, and invokes each of the
					// functions in turn, forwarding the arguments that it got to each.
					return function() {
						for (var i = 0; i < systems.length; i++) {
							systems[i].apply(null, arguments);
						}
					}
				}

				// ## Public API
				//

				return {
					Entity: Entity,
					for_each: for_each,
					count: count,

			// # Example - That Coffee Shop
			//
			// The following example is a bit of a contrived simulation of a typical coffee
			// shop. The inspiration for that came from an article by Gregor Hohpe entitled
			// ["Your Coffee Shop Doesnâ€™t Use Two-Phase Commit"] (http://www.eaipatterns.com/docs/IEEE_Software_Design_2PC.pdf),
			// which is a great but otherwise unrelated read.
			//
			// This example features different states of the simulation, for which we will
			// be using different combinations of systems. It also features entities whose 
			// definition will get updated depending on their progress in the simulation.

		//	(function(ecs) {

			// What the simulation will be modelling is the interaction between
			// customers, the cashier and the baristas. All of these will be entities.

			// Let's start by defining some components for our entities. We'll give all
			// entities a name; which will come in handy for displaying on the console.
				function Named(name) { this.name = name; }				// component!

			// And here is a list of random first names,

			// counting the number of customers they have served.
				function Serving() { this.customers_served = 0; } // component!

			// in which case we track their position in the queue. Or they can be waiting

			//	STATES.

			// Now for the simulation states. We're going to try to model a typical day
			// in a coffee shop. We'll start by opening the shop, then we'll go into full
